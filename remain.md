## âœ… COMPLETED: HomeHub Refactor (Phase 1 Enhancement)

### ðŸŽ‰ Successfully Refactored Multi-Screen Flow to Unified HomeHub Experience!

**What was accomplished:**

1. **âœ… Component Extraction & Refactoring**
   - Extracted SearchScreen logic â†’ SearchSection component
   - Extracted ExploreScreen logic â†’ ExploreSection component  
   - Created new ShareStorySection component with Gen Z language & emojis
   - All sections now use TeaKE design system consistently

2. **âœ… Unified HomeHubScreen Implementation**
   - Created single dynamic screen with react-native-tab-view
   - 3 swipable sections: Search, Share, Explore  
   - Personalized greeting: "Good morning, [User]! ðŸ‘‹ What vibe are we serving today? âœ¨"
   - Profile avatar button in top-right corner
   - Smooth animations and transitions

3. **âœ… Tab Persistence & UX Polish**
   - AsyncStorage integration to remember user's last selected tab
   - Gentle pulse animation on greeting
   - Gen Z language throughout ("bestie", "spill the tea", "no cap")
   - Modern card-based layout with proper spacing
   - Consistent TeaKE color scheme (#D96BA0 primary, soft blush accents)

4. **âœ… Navigation Updates**
   - **REMOVED bottom tab bar entirely** - no more "Hub" at bottom
   - HomeHubScreen is now the main screen (fullscreen experience)
   - Removed individual Search/Explore tabs  
   - Updated routing to direct navigation
   - Clean component architecture with proper exports

**Files Created/Modified:**
- `src/screens/HomeHubScreen.tsx` (new unified screen)
- `src/components/HomeHubSections/SearchSection.tsx` (extracted)
- `src/components/HomeHubSections/ShareStorySection.tsx` (new with prompts)
- `src/components/HomeHubSections/ExploreSection.tsx` (extracted)
- `app/_layout.tsx` (removed tab navigation)
- `app/index.tsx` (main entry point with auth logic)
- **DELETED** `app/(tabs)/` directory entirely

**Result:** Modern, smooth, Gen Z-friendly "social concierge" experience that feels like a unified app rather than separate screens! ðŸŽ¯
