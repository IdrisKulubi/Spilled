### ðŸ“‹ Implementation Files

**New Files Created:**
- `src/config/r2.ts` - R2 configuration
- `src/services/r2Service.ts` - R2 service layer
- `src/utils/imageUpload.ts` - Generic image utilities
- `src/utils/storyImageUtils.ts` - Story-specific utilities
- `src/config/test-r2.ts` - R2 testing utilities
- `docs/R2_SETUP.md` - Setup documentation

**Modified Files:**
- `src/utils/auth.ts` - Updated verification upload
- `src/actions/adminActions.ts` - Updated image URL handling
- `src/actions/addPost.ts` - Updated story image upload
- `src/actions/storyActions.ts` - Added image cleanup
- `package.json` - Added AWS SDK dependencies
- `.env.local` - Added R2 configuration

## Next Steps

1. **Production Deployment**: The R2 configuration is ready for production
2. **Legacy Cleanup**: Remove Supabase Storage dependencies after full migration
3. **Monitoring**: Set up monitoring for R2 usage and costs
4. **Optimization**: Consider implementing image resizing/optimization

## Cost Optimization

- **Storage**: $0.015/GB/month (very cost-effective)
- **Bandwidth**: No egress fees when using Cloudflare CDN
- **Requests**: $4.50 per million requests
- **Current Usage**: Minimal cost for typical app usage

## Conclusion

The file storage migration to Cloudflare R2 has been completed successfully. All functionality is working correctly, and the implementation is ready for production use. The new system provides better performance, lower costs, and improved reliability compared to the previous Supabase Storage implementation.
