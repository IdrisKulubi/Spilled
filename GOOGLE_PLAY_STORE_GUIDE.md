## Current Issue ðŸ”§
The production build failed with a JavaScript bundling error. Here are the steps to fix and proceed:

### 1. Fix Build Issues

**Check the build logs**: https://expo.dev/accounts/vehem23/projects/spilled/builds/aa997d72-60c3-4265-a0f4-9a13afa6759d

**Common solutions:**
```bash
# 1. Clear all caches and reinstall dependencies
npm run reset-project
npm install

# 2. Fix any TypeScript errors
npx tsc --noEmit

# 3. Try building locally first
npx expo export

# 4. Check for environment variable issues
cat .env.production.local
```

### 2. Deploy Your Backend First (IMPORTANT)

Before submitting to Play Store, you MUST deploy your backend:

**Option 1: Deploy to Vercel (Recommended)**
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Deploy your backend
vercel

# Get your production URL (e.g., https://spilled-app.vercel.app)
```

**Option 2: Deploy to Netlify**
```bash
npm install -g netlify-cli
npm run build
netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist
```

### 3. Update Production Environment Variables

Once you have your production backend URL, update `.env.production.local`:

```env
# Replace with your actual production domain
EXPO_PUBLIC_AUTH_BASE_URL=https://your-actual-domain.vercel.app/api/auth
```

### 4. Update Google OAuth Settings

1. Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
2. Find your OAuth 2.0 Client ID
3. Add authorized redirect URIs:
   ```
   https://your-actual-domain.vercel.app/api/auth/google/callback
   spilled://redirect
   ```

### 5. Build Production App (Try Again)

```bash
# Build for production
eas build --platform android --profile production

# If that fails, try preview first
eas build --platform android --profile preview
```

### 6. Google Play Console Setup

1. **Create Developer Account**
   - Go to: https://play.google.com/console
   - Pay $25 one-time registration fee
   - Complete account verification

2. **Create New App**

### 8. App Content Rating

### 10. Release Configuration

**App Signing**

- Production (public release)

Start with "Internal testing" first.

### 11. Testing Strategy

**Before Production Release:**

1. **Internal Testing**
   ```bash
   # Build and upload to internal track
   eas build --platform android --profile production
   eas submit --platform android --track internal
   ```

2. **Add Test Users**
   - Add email addresses of testers
   - Share the internal testing link
   - Gather feedback

3. **Beta Testing**
   - Move to closed testing track
   - Get more user feedback
   - Fix any critical issues

4. **Production Release**
   - Submit for production
   - App review process (1-3 days)
   - Monitor for crashes/issues
